# LerfFusion 
In this project, we propose the task of natural-language-guided object editing in NeRF-based novel view synthesis. We uses Nerfacto as the base model to update, and uses [stable difussion inpainting](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting) to perform dataset-NeRF dual updating.    
### Getting Started  
We use NerfStudio for integration pipelining. Refer to [this documentation](https://docs.nerf.studio/en/latest/developer_guides/new_methods.html) for more details. Follow [this link](https://docs.nerf.studio/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) to install environment and dependencies.
