# LerfFusion 
In this project, we propose the task of natural-language-guided object editing in NeRF-based novel view synthesis. We uses [Nerfacto](https://docs.nerf.studio/en/latest/nerfology/methods/nerfacto.html) as the base model to update, and uses [stable difussion inpainting](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting) to perform dataset-NeRF dual updating.
